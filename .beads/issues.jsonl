This epic makes it PROACTIVE with a structured molecule:\n\n```\nDeacon Wake\n├── Step 0: Session Check (should I cycle myself?)\n├── Step 1: Health Scan (Mayor, Witnesses, Crew, Refineries)\n├── Step 2: Lifecycle Processing (cycle/restart/shutdown requests)\n├── Step 3: Plugin Execution (scheduled, event-triggered, human-requested)\n├── Step 4: Event Callbacks (timers, subscriptions)\n└── Step 5: Heartbeat + Wait\n```\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\n1. **Session cycling first** - Token costs are quadratic with session length.\n   Deacon should aggressively cycle to fresh sessions. First step of every\n   wake is \"do I need a new session?\" based on context budget.\n\n2. **Pinned bead with marching orders** - A pinned bead (like gt prime for\n   agents) defines the Deacon's rounds molecule. This is the Deacon's\n   \"kernel\" - its operating loop.\n\n3. **Keepalive file for daemon quieting** - Instead of daemon tmux-poking\n   the Deacon (which interrupts work), Deacon writes a keepalive file.\n   Daemon reads it and backs off. Worst case: Deacon forgets, gets one\n   extra heartbeat it squelches.\n\n4. **Molecule-based rounds** - The wake cycle becomes a molecule with steps.\n   Each step can have plugins (inline attention). Steps can be added/modified\n   by updating the pinned bead.\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\nGo Daemon (minimal, dumb)\n├── Reads {townRoot}/deacon/keepalive.json\n├── If fresh: do nothing\n├── If stale: poke Deacon (fallback)\n└── Process lifecycle requests (still daemon's job)\n\nDeacon (Claude agent, smart)\n├── Wakes: poke, timer, mail event\n├── Writes keepalive (quiets daemon for duration of rounds)\n├── Runs rounds molecule:\n│   ├── session-check: cycle if context budget low\n│   ├── health-scan: check agents, remediate\n│   ├── lifecycle: process requests\n│   ├── plugins: run scheduled/triggered plugins\n│   ├── events: process timer/event callbacks\n│   └── complete: update heartbeat, wait\n└── Reads marching orders from pinned bead\n```\n\n## Relation to Existing Work\n\n- Extends gt-5af (Deacon infrastructure) - CLOSED\n- Relates to gt-axz (Plugin architecture) - P3\n- Fits into phase3-deacon of gt-ngpz (Christmas Plan)\n- Enables gt-976 (Crew lifecycle) as part of health-scan step\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:46:08.076178-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.610323-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-id36","depends_on_id":"gt-976","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:48:05.215593-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.610323-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

Return to process-branch.\nOtherwise continue to summary.\nNeeds: merge-push\n\n## Step: generate-summary\nSummarize cycle: branches processed, tests results, issues filed.\nNeeds: loop-check\n\n## Step: context-check\nCheck context usage.\nIf high: write handoff, prepare for burn/respawn.\nNeeds: generate-summary\n\n## Step: burn-or-loop\nIf context LOW and queue non-empty: loop (return to queue-scan)\nIf context HIGH or queue empty: burn and exit\nNeeds: context-check\n```\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Add RefineryPatrolMolecule() to builtin_molecules.go\n- Copy pattern from DeaconPatrolMolecule\n- Include all steps with proper `Needs:` dependencies\n- Emphasize handle-failures gate in description\n\n### 2. Update Refinery CLAUDE.md\nAdd sections:\n- **The Engineer Mindset** (identity/philosophy)\n- **The Scotty Test** (Would Scotty walk past this?)\n- **Patrol Molecule** reference (mol-refinery-patrol)\n- **Test Failure Protocol** (explicit decision tree)\n\n### 3. Create prompts/roles/refinery.md\n- Follow pattern of deacon.md\n- Include patrol execution loop diagram\n- Reference the molecule\n\n### 4. Consider mol-witness-patrol\n- Witness has detailed heartbeat protocol but no formal molecule\n- Similar pattern could apply\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nGUPP: 'If you have work on your hook, you have to run it.'\nThe patrol molecule puts failure handling ON THE HOOK as a mandatory step.\nYou can't skip handle-failures to get to merge-push.\nThe structure enforces good behavior.\n\n## Related\n- gt-7919: Fix failing beads tests (discovered during this session)\n- mol-deacon-patrol (existing pattern to follow)\n- docs/molecular-chemistry.md (chemistry concepts)\n- docs/wisp-architecture.md (wisp vs mol decision)","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-22T13:01:48.588945-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:25:59.95284-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:25:59.95284-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"feature"}

Agents shouldn't have to memorize the 'correct' command structure.\n\n## Proposal\n\nAdd subcommands to each role that delegate to core commands with argument reordering:\n\n```\ngt witness nudge furiosa \"Start working\"\n  → gt nudge gt-gastown-furiosa \"Start working\"\n\ngt polecat nudge gastown/furiosa \"Check mail\"\n  → gt nudge gt-gastown-furiosa \"Check mail\"\n\ngt crew nudge gastown/max \"Wake up\"\n  → gt nudge gt-crew-gastown-max \"Wake up\"\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Discoverable**: Agents explore `gt witness --help` and find nudge\n2. **Lenient**: Multiple valid ways to express the same intent\n3. **Role-contextual**: Commands under the role namespace feel natural\n4. **Extensible**: Pattern works for future subcommands (status, reset, etc.)\n\n## Implementation\n\nEach role command (witness, polecat, crew, refinery) gets thin wrapper subcommands:\n\n```go\n// In witness.go\nwitnessCmd.AddCommand(\u0026cobra.Command{\n    Use:   \"nudge \u003cpolecat\u003e \u003cmessage\u003e\",\n    Short: \"Nudge a polecat (delegates to gt nudge)\",\n    RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {\n        session := formatSession(rig, args[0])\n        return runNudge(session, args[1])\n    },\n})\n```\n\n## Future Candidates\n\nOther subcommands to add as role-specific aliases:\n- `gt polecat status \u003cname\u003e` (already exists, good pattern)\n- `gt witness check \u003cpolecat\u003e` → trigger a manual check\n- `gt refinery merge \u003cmr-id\u003e` → process specific MR\n- `gt crew send \u003cmember\u003e \u003cmessage\u003e` → mail to crew member","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-21T14:05:17.303809-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:56.628234-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:56.628234-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"feature"}

Town Setup (gt install / gt town init)\n\n- Create ~/gt/.beads-wisp/ directory during town initialization\n- Initialize as git repo (for local commits, not synced)\n- Add config.yaml with wisp: true\n- Ensure .beads-wisp/ is gitignored at town level\n\nFiles:\n- internal/cmd/install.go (or equivalent town init)\n- internal/town/manager.go (if exists)\n\n### 2.

The witness, refinery, and polecat lifecycle components didn't coordinate automatically.\n\n## What Should Have Happened\n\n```\nMayor slings 6 beads to rig\n    ↓\nPolecats auto-spawn with synced beads, work pinned\n    ↓\nPolecats work autonomously\n    ↓\nWitness monitors progress, nudges stuck polecats\n    ↓\nPolecat completes → pushes branch → signals completion\n    ↓\nRefinery detects ready branch → rebases → merges → deletes branch\n    ↓\nWitness detects merge → nukes polecat worktree\n    ↓\nWhen all done → Witness notifies Mayor\n```\n\n## What Actually Happened\n\n1. **gt sling failed to pin beads** - polecat worktrees had stale JSONL\n2. **Manual intervention** - had to checkout latest JSONL, pin, nudge each polecat\n3. **Witness was passive** - never nudged or checked on polecats\n4. **Refinery waited for requests** - didn't detect completed branches\n5. **Manual lifecycle** - Mayor had to close beads, nuke polecats\n6. **Manual merge coordination** - had to mail refinery with merge order\n\n## Root Cause: Branch Hysteresis\n\nPolecat branches persist across runs and drift from main/beads-sync:\n- `polecat/foo` created weeks ago from old main\n- New work slung to `polecat/foo` \n- JSONL in branch doesn't have new beads\n- Pin fails\n\n## Open Questions\n\n### Q1: Fresh branches per run?\nShould each polecat spawn create a NEW branch from latest main/beads-sync?\n```\ngt sling bd-xxx rig\n  → creates polecat/foo-20251227-1630 from origin/main\n  → ensures JSONL is current\n  → after merge, branch deleted forever\n```\nPros: No drift, always current\nCons: Branch proliferation, naming complexity\n\n### Q2: Rebase existing branches?\nOr should we rebase persistent polecat branches before work?\n```\ngt sling bd-xxx rig/foo\n  → git fetch origin\n  → git rebase origin/main\n  → now JSONL is current\n```\nPros: Keeps simple naming\nCons: Rebase can fail with conflicts\n\n### Q3: Just cherry-pick JSONL?\nMinimal fix - grab latest JSONL before pinning:\n```\ngit checkout origin/beads-sync -- .beads/issues.jsonl\nbd import  # refresh DB\nbd pin bd-xxx\n```\nPros: Simple, surgical\nCons: Doesn't fix code drift, just beads\n\n### Q4: Shared beads DB?\nCould polecats share a DB (via symlink or sqlite over network)?\nPros: Always consistent\nCons: Locking complexity, daemon conflicts\n\n### Q5: Who owns polecat lifecycle?\n- Witness? (current assumption)\n- Refinery? (after merge)\n- gt sling? (on spawn)\n- New \"foreman\" role?\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\nSee child issues for implementation details.

{"id":"gt-witness-role","title":"Witness Role Definition","description":"You are the Witness - per-rig worker monitor. You watch polecats, nudge them\ntoward completion, verify clean git state before kills, and escalate stuck\nworkers to the Mayor.\n\nYou do NOT do implementation work. Your job is oversight, not coding.\n\ndefault_molecule: mol-witness-patrol\ncapabilities:\n  - monitor_workers\n  - nudge_stuck\n  - pre_kill_verify\n  - session_lifecycle\n  - escalation\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n\n1. Monitor workers: Track polecat health and progress\n2. Nudge: Prompt slow workers toward completion\n3. Pre-kill verification: Ensure git state is clean before killing sessions\n4. Session lifecycle: Kill sessions, update worker state\n5. Self-cycling: Hand off to fresh session when context fills\n6. Escalation: Report stuck workers to Mayor\n\nKey principle: You own ALL per-worker cleanup. Mayor is never involved in\nroutine worker management.\n\n## Propulsion Principle\n\nIf you find something on your hook, YOU RUN IT.\n\nYour work is defined by the mol-witness-patrol molecule. Execute steps:\n- bd ready (find next step)\n- bd show \u003cstep-id\u003e (see what to do)\n- bd close \u003cstep-id\u003e (mark complete)\n\n## Nudge Protocol\n\nProgress through stages. Track nudge count per worker per issue.\n- First Nudge (10+ min idle): Gentle inquiry\n- Second Nudge (15 min): Direct question\n- Third Nudge (20 min): Final warning\nAfter 3 nudges with no progress -\u003e escalate to Mayor\n\n## Pre-Kill Verification\n\nBefore killing ANY polecat session:\n1. gt polecat git-state \u003cname\u003e - Must be clean\n2.

The message arrives before\nthe prompt is ready, so it appears as part of the prompt string instead of\nbeing executed.\n\n## Solution\n\nMove priming responsibility to the Deacon patrol cycle:\n\n1. gt spawn: Mark polecat as pending_prime=true in state, return immediately\n2. Deacon patrol: New step prime-pending-workers that:\n   - Scans all rigs for workers with pending_prime=true\n   - Uses WaitForClaudeReady() to poll for \"\u003e \" prompt (already exists in tmux.go)\n   - Once ready, sends gt prime + assignment nudge\n   - Clears pending_prime flag\n\n## Implementation\n\n### spawn.go changes\n- Remove the 3-second sleep (line 368)\n- Remove the NudgeSession call (lines 375-383)\n- Instead: Update polecat state with pending_prime=true\n\n### Polecat state addition\nstatus: assigned, pending_prime: true, issue: gt-xxx\n\n### Deacon patrol addition\nAdd step between inbox-check and plugin-run:\nprime-pending-workers: Check all rigs for workers marked pending_prime.\nFor each pending worker: WaitForClaudeReady(60s), then gt prime + nudge\n\n### Benefits\n- No race condition - we poll until actually ready\n- Deacon already does health checks - priming is natural fit\n- Works for polecats, witnesses, refineries, crew (unified approach)\n- Timeout handling built in\n\n## Depends on\n- Existing WaitForClaudeReady() in tmux.go (lines 384-403)","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-22T17:19:33.589909-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.124884-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.124884-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}

Overlap between gt and bd\n\n| Concept | gt | bd |\n|---------|----|----|\n| Hook | `gt hook` | `bd pin`, `bd hook` |\n| Mail | `gt mail` | `bd mail` (delegates) |\n| Molecules | `gt mol` (17 cmds) | `bd mol` (5 cmds) |\n\nWhich owns what? User confusion likely.\n\n### 3. Naming inconsistencies\n\n- `gt polecat` (noun) vs `gt spawn` (verb) - both about polecats\n- `gt done` vs `gt handoff` - both end work but different\n- `bd mol run` vs `bd pour` - both instantiate\n\n### 4. Subcommand depth decisions\n\n**Good patterns:**\n- `bd mol {catalog|show|bond|run|distill}` - coherent group\n- `gt mail {send|inbox|read|archive}` - coherent group\n\n**Questionable patterns:**\n- `bd create --wisp` AND `bd wisp create` - two ways to do same thing\n- `gt spawn --molecule X` AND `gt mol instantiate` - overlap\n\n### 5. Flag vs subcommand guidelines needed\n\nWhen to use flags vs subcommands?\n- `--json` as flag ✓ (modifier)\n- `--wisp` as flag for create? Or separate `bd wisp create`?\n- `--molecule` on spawn? Or separate workflow?\n\n## Recommendations to Evaluate\n\n### A. Consolidate gt top-level commands\n\nGroup related commands:\n```\ngt agent {mayor|deacon|witness|refinery|polecat}\ngt work {spawn|sling|hook|handoff|done}\ngt infra {daemon|up|down|doctor}\n```\n\n### B. Clarify gt vs bd ownership\n\n| Domain | Owner | Other defers |\n|--------|-------|--------------|\n| Issues | bd | gt uses bd |\n| Agents | gt | bd doesn't touch |\n| Molecules | bd mol | gt mol wraps for UX |\n| Hooks | bd pin/hook | gt hook wraps |\n| Mail | gt mail | bd mail delegates |\n\n### C. Apply consistent naming\n\n- All agent commands: nouns (`gt polecat`, `gt mayor`)\n- All work commands: verbs (`gt spawn`, `gt sling`, `gt hook`)\n- Avoid synonyms: pick one term and stick with it\n\n### D. Flag vs subcommand rule\n\n- Flags: modify behavior of command (`--json`, `--force`, `--wisp`)\n- Subcommands: distinct operations (`mol run`, `mol squash`, `mol burn`)\n- Exception: very common operations can have top-level aliases\n\n## Tasks\n\n1. [ ] Review gt command groupings - propose consolidation\n2. [ ] Review bd command groupings - check for sprawl\n3. [ ] Document gt vs bd ownership boundaries\n4. [ ] Identify and resolve naming inconsistencies\n5. [ ] Document flag vs subcommand decision criteria\n6. [ ] Create migration plan for any breaking changes\n7. [ ] Update help text to be consistent\n8. [ ] Test agent UX: can Claude guess commands correctly?\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- New user can guess command structure intuitively\n- `gt --help` fits on one screen (or is well-categorized)\n- No duplicate functionality between gt and bd\n- Consistent naming throughout\n- Claude agents can discover commands without documentation","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-24T23:48:42.420867-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.547876-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-mbyy","depends_on_id":"gt-jo9n","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-24T23:48:52.221824-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.547876-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

For each task:\n   - Fetch polecat branch\n   - Attempt merge to integration/\u003cswarm-id\u003e\n   - On conflict: semantic resolution (understand intent, re-implement)\n   - Run tests if configured\n   - On success: mark merged, file bead, notify witness\n   - On failure: notify polecat (test fail) or escalate (stuck)\n3. When all tasks merged: land integration to main\n\n## Semantic Merge\n\nWhen git merge fails, Refinery:\n1. Reads polecat changes and beads issue\n2. Understands intent\n3.

{"id":"gt-7918","title":"Patrols: Cyclic molecules for autonomous maintenance","description":"## Vision\n\nPatrols are **cyclic molecules** - workflow loops that give Gas Town its autonomous nervous system. While regular molecules are DAGs that terminate, patrols loop forever, performing maintenance tasks at varying cadences.\n\nThis is the \"steam engine\" of Gas Town: converting episodic Claude sessions into continuous autonomous operation.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### 1. Cyclic Molecules\n\nRegular molecule:     A -\u003e B -\u003e C -\u003e done\nPatrol molecule:      A -\u003e B -\u003e C --+\n                      ^             |\n                      +-------------+\n\nPatrols have a loop_to field specifying where to restart.\n\n### 2. Cooldown-Aware Steps (Atoms)\n\nSteps encode their own cadence. When patrol reaches a step:\n1. Check: now - last_run \u003e cooldown?\n2. If yes: execute, update last_run\n3. If no: skip (immediately close)\n\nThe patrol runner is simple - steps self-skip. Complexity distributed into atoms.\n\n### 3. The Beacon\n\nThe heartbeat that fires patrol triggers:\n- Internal ticker in Deacon (goroutine)\n- Or external cron firing gt deacon tick\n- Or mail-based triggers\n\nWithout beacon, nothing proactive happens.\n\n### 4. Session Reset as Patrol Step\n\nConnects to auto-handoff (gt-bcwn). Session reset is a patrol step, not a separate mechanism.\n\n### 5. Multi-Role Patrols\n\nEach supervisor has its own patrol:\n\n**Deacon patrol:** health-check (30s), session-gc (5m), beacon-tick (10s)\n**Witness patrol:** orphan-scan (10m), stuck-check (2m), molecule-progress (1m)\n**Refinery patrol:** queue-check (30s), pr-status (1m), merge-ready (30s)\n\n### 6. Cadence Tiers\n\n- Critical (10-30s): Health checks\n- Active (1-5m): Progress, nudges\n- Maintenance (10-30m): Orphans, GC\n- Periodic (1h+): Reports\n\n### 7. Best-Effort Scheduling\n\nNot real-time - more like cron. No hard deadlines. Catch-up, dont pile-up.\nPriority preemption (mail interrupts patrol). Graceful degradation under load.\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. State persistence: Beads (self-describing) or file (faster)?\n2. Interruption: How does urgent mail preempt patrol?\n3. Error recovery: Backoff? Escalate? Circuit breaker?\n4. Coordination: Can patrols send mail to trigger other patrols?\n\n## Related\n\n- gt-bcwn: Auto-handoff (session reset is a patrol step)\n- Molecule system (patrols extend molecules with loops)\n- Deacon lifecycle management\n\n## Metaphor\n\nClaude was fire. Claude Code was steam. Gas Town is the steam engine. Beads is the train tracks.\n\nThe steam engine converts episodic combustion into continuous rotary motion.\nGas Town converts episodic Claude sessions into continuous autonomous work.","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-21T12:18:22.99128-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.576866-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-7918","depends_on_id":"gt-bcwn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-21T12:18:30.86651-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.576866-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

Remove top-level gt spawn\n\n- Keep `gt spawn pending` as subcommand if still needed\n- Remove `gt spawn` from root commands\n- Update all docs and CLAUDE.md references\n\n### 3. Unified UX Design\n\nTarget resolution (smart defaults):\n```bash\ngt sling gt-abc                    # Self (current agent)\ngt sling gt-abc crew               # Crew worker in current rig  \ngt sling gt-abc gastown            # Auto-spawn polecat in rig\ngt sling gt-abc gastown/Toast      # Specific polecat\ngt sling gt-abc mayor              # Mayor\n```\n\nKey flags:\n```bash\ngt sling gt-abc --args \"patch release\"   # Natural language context\ngt sling gt-abc --naked                  # No-tmux mode (manual start)\ngt sling gt-abc --create                 # Create polecat if missing\ngt sling gt-abc --molecule mol-review    # Use specific workflow\n```\n\n### 4. Update Witness/Refinery/Deacon\n\nThese agents currently use `gt spawn`. Update to use `gt sling`:\n- Witness: spawning polecats for work\n- Refinery: spawning merge workers  \n- Deacon: any spawn logic\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All spawn flags available in sling\n- [ ] `gt spawn` removed (or hidden/deprecated)\n- [ ] Witness uses `gt sling \u003crig\u003e` for polecat work\n- [ ] Docs updated\n- [ ] Both human and agent UX is clean","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-26T13:35:55.902844-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.90011-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.90011-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"feature"}

If nothing → wait for assignment\n\n## Critical Path\n\n1. **Slinging Handoff** - `gt sling \u003cbead\u003e` attaches work and restarts\n2. **Hook Execution** - Agent wakes, primes, reads hook, runs hook\n3. **Polecat Work Cycle** - Spawn → work → submit → complete\n4. **Deacon Patrol** - The loop that spawns polecats\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- `gt sling gt-xxx` restarts agent with work attached\n- Agent wakes up and automatically begins work\n- Single polecat completes one issue end-to-end\n- Deacon can spawn polecats on demand\n\n## Non-Goals (v0.1)\n\n- Autonomous Witness nudging\n- Autonomous Refinery merging\n- Multi-polecat coordination\n- Self-healing from crashes\n\nThese are v0.2+.

{"id":"gt-p3v5n","title":"Witness Arm Bonding","description":"# Witness Patrol Redesign\n\n\u003e **Status**: Design pivoted from Christmas Ornament to linear patrol (Dec 2024)\n\n## Original Problem\n\nWitness needs to monitor and intervene on multiple polecats. Original design proposed \"Christmas Ornament\" pattern with dynamic arms per polecat and fanout gates.\n\n## Design Pivot: Why Christmas Ornament Was Wrong\n\nThe Christmas Ornament pattern (dynamic mol-polecat-arm per worker) felt un-Gas-Town:\n\n1. **Explicit state tracking**: Nudge counts, timestamps, per-polecat state\n2. **Complex machinery**: Dynamic bonding, fanout gates, aggregation\n3. **Against philosophy**: Gas Town prefers discovery over tracking, events over state\n\n**Key insight**: With step-based polecat sessions (`gt mol step done` restarts session each step), polecats are either working a step or starting a step. \"Nudge counts across sessions\" becomes less meaningful.\n\n## New Design: Linear Patrol + Task Tool Parallelism + Cleanup Wisps\n\n### Patrol Shape (Deacon-style)\n\n```\ninbox-check -\u003e process-cleanups -\u003e check-refinery -\u003e survey-workers -\u003e context-check -\u003e loop\n```\n\nNo dynamic arms. No fanout gates. Linear and simple.\n\n### Key Changes\n\n| Aspect | Old (Christmas Ornament) | New (Linear Patrol) |\n|--------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| Per-polecat inspection | mol-polecat-arm bonded dynamically | Task tool subagents within survey-workers |\n| State tracking | Persistent nudge counts in handoff bead | Fresh observation each cycle (discover from beads timestamps) |\n| Cleanup queue | Explicit list in patrol state | Cleanup wisps (finalizer pattern) |\n| Parallelism | Molecule arms (fanout gate) | Task tool subagents |\n| Aggregation | waits_for: all-children | Task tool returns |\n\n### The Finalizer Pattern (Cleanup Wisps)\n\nWhen POLECAT_DONE arrives, Witness creates a cleanup wisp:\n```bash\nbd create --wisp --title \"cleanup:ace\" --labels cleanup,polecat:ace\n```\n\nThe wisp's existence IS the pending cleanup. Witness processes these in `process-cleanups` step:\n- Verify git clean, issue closed, commits exist\n- Kill session, remove worktree\n- Burn the wisp\n\nFailed cleanups? Leave wisp, retry next cycle. GC-style finalization.\n\n### Task Tool Parallelism\n\nInstead of molecule arms, use Claude's Task tool for parallel polecat inspection:\n\n```markdown\n## survey-workers step\n\nFor each polecat, launch a Task tool subagent:\n- Capture tmux state\n- Assess working/idle/error/done\n- Check beads for step progress\n- Decide and execute action (nudge/escalate/none)\n\nTask tool handles parallelism. No molecule machinery needed.\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\n- [x] Draft mol-witness-patrol-v2.formula.toml (linear patrol)\n- [ ] Test new patrol formula\n- [ ] Deprecate mol-polecat-arm\n- [ ] Remove fanout gate dependency\n\n## Files\n\n- `.beads/formulas/mol-witness-patrol-v2.formula.toml` - New linear patrol\n- `.beads/formulas/mol-witness-patrol.formula.toml` - Old Christmas Ornament (to deprecate)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Witness patrols work with 3+ polecats using Task tool parallelism\n- Cleanup wisps correctly track pending cleanups\n- No persistent nudge state - fresh observation each cycle\n- Simpler, more Gas Town-y design","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:46:22.29819-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.489656-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-p3v5n","depends_on_id":"gt-psj76","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:47:17.026491-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"gt-p3v5n","depends_on_id":"gt-twjr5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:55:05.133165-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.489656-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

Molecules don't get a separate YAML format - they're issues with `type: molecule` containing prose-based step definitions.\n\nAgents don't need rigid schemas. They parse natural language natively. A molecule is just instructions with enough structure for tooling.\n\n## Example: Engineer in a Box\n\n```markdown\nid: mol-xyz\ntype: molecule\ntitle: Engineer in a Box\n\nThis workflow takes a task from design to merge.\n\n## Step: design\nThink carefully about architecture. Consider existing patterns, \ntrade-offs, testability.\n\n## Step: implement\nWrite clean code. Follow codebase conventions.\nNeeds: design\n\n## Step: review  \nReview for bugs, edge cases, style issues.\nNeeds: implement\n\n## Step: test\nWrite and run tests. Cover happy path and edge cases.\nNeeds: implement\n\n## Step: submit\nSubmit for merge via refinery.\nNeeds: review, test\n```\n\n## Instantiation\n\n```bash\n# Attach molecule when spawning\ngt spawn --issue gt-abc --molecule mol-xyz\n\n# Creates child beads atomically:\ngt-abc.design     ← ready first\ngt-abc.implement  ← blocked by design  \ngt-abc.review     ← blocked by implement\ngt-abc.test       ← blocked by implement\ngt-abc.submit     ← blocked by review, test\n```\n\nEach step issue gets an `instantiated-from` edge to the molecule (with step metadata).\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n1. **Unified data plane**: Everything in Beads, no parallel YAML channel\n2. **AI-native**: Prose instructions, not rigid schemas\n3. **Error isolation**: Each step is a checkpoint - failure doesn't lose progress\n4. **Scales with AI**: As agents get smarter, they handle more complex molecules\n\n## Implementation Primitives\n\n- `ParseMoleculeSteps()`: Extract steps from prose (convention-based)\n- `InstantiateMolecule()`: Atomic transaction creating all steps + edges  \n- `instantiated-from` edge type: Track provenance\n- Parameterization: `{{variable}}` substitution from context map","status":"tombstone","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-18T18:06:24.573068-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.595678-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.595678-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

Add `gt handoff` command for polecats to request shutdown\n2. Modify gt spawn to always create fresh worktree\n3. Run bd init in new worktree (beads needs initialization)\n4. Add shutdown request handler to Witness\n5. Witness verifies handoff, then cleans up:\n   - Kill session\n   - Remove worktree\n   - Delete branch\n6.

{"id":"gt-qvn7.1","title":"Phase 1: Slinging Handoff","description":"# Phase 1: Slinging Handoff\n\nThe restart-and-resume loop. This is the fundamental propulsion mechanism.\n\n## What It Does\n\n```bash\ngt sling gt-xxx\n```\n\n1. Creates a wisp on the agent's hook containing the bead\n2. Sends handoff mail (optional context)\n3. Triggers session restart (daemon SIGUSR1 or direct respawn)\n4. Fresh Claude wakes up\n5. SessionStart hook runs `gt prime`\n6. Agent reads hook → finds the slung bead\n7. Agent executes the work\n\n## Why Wisp, Not Mol\n\nThe sling is ephemeral scaffolding. It says \"run this bead\" - nothing more.\nOnce the work is picked up, the wisp can be burned. No permanent record needed\nfor the handoff wrapper itself; the actual work is tracked in the bead.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### gt sling command\n\n```go\n// cmd: gt sling \u003cbead-id\u003e [-s subject] [-m message]\nfunc sling(beadID string, subject, message string) {\n    // 1.

This means:\n- Formulas don't need \"infinite loop with burn-and-respawn\"\n- loop is only for **inner loops** (refinery's per-branch processing)\n- \"burn-or-loop\" = complete cycle; daemon decides next action\n- Context cycling is external, not algebraic\n\nThis significantly simplifies the algebra.\n\n### Gap: for-each is Missing\n\nThe current proposal doesn't include for-each, but it's essential for patrol patterns:\n\n| Pattern | Use Case |\n|---------|----------|\n| Witness survey-workers | For each polecat, bond an arm (parallel) |\n| Refinery process-branch | For each branch in queue, run merge pipeline (sequential) |\n| Deacon plugin-run | For each plugin where gate open, execute |\n\nProposed syntax:\n\n    for-each:\n      collection: \"survey-workers.output.polecats\"\n      bond: mol-polecat-arm\n      vars:\n        polecat_name: \"{item.name}\"\n      parallel: true\n\nThis overlaps with gt-8tmz.8 (runtime dynamic expansion). Decision needed:\n- Include for-each here as control flow, OR\n- Ensure gt-8tmz.8 covers these patterns adequately\n\n### Gap: waits-for Gate Variant\n\nThe \"fanout gate\" pattern (aggregate waits for all dynamically-bonded children)\nneeds formalization:\n\n    step: aggregate\n    waits-for: children-of(survey-workers)\n\nCurrently exists in formulas as waits_for: \"all-children\" but not in the algebra spec.\n\n### What This Covers\n\nWith these operators (plus for-each), patrols become fully expressible:\n\n**Witness Patrol:**\n- for-each polecat -\u003e bond mol-polecat-arm (parallel)\n- gate with waits-for: all-children for aggregation\n\n**Refinery Patrol:**\n- for-each branch -\u003e process pipeline (sequential)\n- gate for test verification before merge\n\n**Deacon Patrol:**\n- for-each plugin -\u003e execute if gate open\n- Simple sequence otherwise\n\n### Scope Decision\n\n**Option A**: Implement loop, gate, branch now. Track for-each and waits-for separately.\n\n**Option B**: Expand scope to include for-each and waits-for formalization.\n\nRecommendation: Option A - implement core constructs, create child issues for gaps.","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T18:04:33.194896-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:55.880458-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-8tmz.4","depends_on_id":"gt-8tmz","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-23T18:04:33.196543-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"gt-8tmz.4","depends_on_id":"gt-8tmz.7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-23T18:04:49.985527-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:55.880458-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}

Deacon checks which are due\nand executes them during the plugins step of rounds.\n\n## Plugin Registration\n\nPlugins are registered in:\n1. Pinned kernel bead (preferred)\n2. `{townRoot}/plugins/` directory scan (fallback)\n\nEach plugin has:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"beads-hygiene\",\n  \"schedule\": \"0 2 * * *\",\n  \"last_run\": \"2025-12-20T02:00:00Z\",\n  \"enabled\": true,\n  \"attention_budget\": \"low\",\n  \"max_duration_minutes\": 30\n}\n```\n\n## Schedule Format\n\nStandard cron format: `minute hour day month weekday`\n- `0 2 * * *` - 2 AM daily\n- `0 4 * * 0` - 4 AM Sundays\n- `*/15 * * * *` - Every 15 minutes\n\n## Execution\n\nDuring plugins step:\n1. Load plugin schedules from kernel bead + directory\n2. For each plugin:\n   a. Parse schedule, check if due (last_run + schedule)\n   b. If due, execute:\n      - Read `plugins/{name}/CLAUDE.md` for context\n      - Run plugin logic (inline or spawn subagent)\n      - Record outcome and update last_run\n3. Continue to next step\n\n## Plugin Execution Modes\n\n- **inline**: Deacon runs the plugin logic directly (simple, fast)\n- **subagent**: Spawn a polecat-like agent for the plugin (complex, parallel)\n- **mail**: Send mail to another agent to do the work (delegation)\n\n## State Tracking\n\n`{townRoot}/deacon/plugin-state.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": {\n    \"beads-hygiene\": {\n      \"last_run\": \"2025-12-20T02:00:00Z\",\n      \"last_outcome\": \"success\",\n      \"run_count\": 42,\n      \"failure_count\": 2\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Relation to gt-axz\n\nThis implements the execution side of the plugin architecture (gt-axz).\ngt-axz defines the format; this task implements the scheduler.\n","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:47:31.798518-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:56.694888-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-id36.5","depends_on_id":"gt-id36","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:47:31.800001-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:56.694888-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}

Unlike polecats which are witness-managed and ephemeral, crew workers are:\n\n- **Persistent**: Not auto-garbage-collected\n- **User-managed**: Overseer controls lifecycle\n- **Long-lived identities**: dave, emma, fred - recognizable names\n- **Gas Town integrated**: Mail, handoff mechanics work\n- **Tmux optional**: Can work in terminal directly\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\n\u003crig\u003e/\n  polecats/       # Managed workers (witness controls)\n  refinery/       # Merge queue processor\n  witness/        # Pit boss\n  crew/           # Overseer's personal workspaces\n    dave/         # Full clone, persistent\n    emma/         # Full clone, persistent\n    fred/         # Full clone, persistent\n```\n\n## Key Differences from Polecats\n\n- Location: crew/ instead of polecats/\n- Lifecycle: User-managed, not witness-managed\n- Auto-cleanup: Never (polecats auto-cleanup on swarm land)\n- Issue assignment: Optional (polecats require it)\n- Tmux: Optional (polecats require it)\n- Mail \u0026 Handoff: Yes for both\n- Identity: Persistent (polecats are ephemeral)\n\n## CLI Commands\n\n- gt crew add \u003cname\u003e [--rig \u003crig\u003e] - Create crew workspace\n- gt crew list [--rig \u003crig\u003e] - List crew workspaces\n- gt crew at \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e - Attach to workspace (start session)\n- gt crew attach \u003cname\u003e - Attach (infer rig from cwd)\n- gt crew refresh \u003cname\u003e - Handoff + restart (context cycling)\n- gt crew remove \u003cname\u003e [--force] - Remove workspace\n- gt crew status [\u003cname\u003e] - Show workspace status\n\n## Design Notes\n\n- Crew workers use full git clones (not worktrees)\n- Optional beads integration via BEADS_DIR\n- Mail-to-self handoff works for context cycling\n- No witness monitoring or nudging\n- No automatic issue assignment required\n\n## Background\n\nUsers often maintain separate repo clones for serial agent work. This is tedious to set up manually. Crew workspaces bring these into Gas Town's infrastructure while keeping user control.","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-16T16:47:37.529887-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-25T01:30:41.67682-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-25T01:30:41.67682-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"epic"}

Mail is just:\n- Handoffs (agent → self)\n- Commands (Mayor → Refinery)\n- Escalations (Witness → Mayor)\n\nThese can all be beads issues with a special prefix.\n\n## Design\n\n### Convention\n- Messages use `@-` prefix: `@-witness-1734012345`\n- Assignee = recipient\n- Status: open = unread, closed = read/acknowledged\n- Priority 0 = urgent\n\n### Commands (thin wrappers)\n```bash\ngt mail send witness -s \"Subject\" -m \"Body\"\n  → bd create --prefix=@ --title=\"Subject\" --assignee=witness --description=\"Body\"\n\ngt mail inbox\n  → bd list --prefix=@ --assignee=$(gt whoami) --status=open\n\ngt mail read @-abc\n  → bd show @-abc \u0026\u0026 bd close @-abc\n```\n\n### Notification\nDaemon watches for new `@-` issues and pokes relevant sessions.\nOr: agents poll on heartbeat (simpler).\n\n## What We Remove\n- `mail/inbox.jsonl` files\n- Mail JSONL read/write code\n- Separate delivery mechanism\n\n## What We Keep\n- `gt mail` CLI (as wrapper)\n- Handoff semantics\n- Notification (via daemon or polling)\n\n## Benefits\n- One system, one sync, one query interface\n- All communication in git history\n- Simpler architecture\n\n## Risks\n- Beads prefix filtering must be efficient\n- Namespace collision with user prefixes\n- Performance for high-frequency messages (probably fine for handoffs)\n\n## Decision Point\nDo we need first-class mail support in beads (`bd mail` commands) or is convention sufficient?","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-16T02:10:18.32879-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-25T01:30:41.67682-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-25T01:30:41.67682-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"gt-ingm","title":"Molecular Chemistry Cleanup: Fix inaccurate molecule depictions","description":"## The Correct Model\n\nAccording to molecular-chemistry.md, the hierarchy is:\n\nFormula (YAML DSL) --cook--\u003e Proto (template beads) --pour/wisp--\u003e Mol/Wisp (actual work)\n\n- **Formulas**: YAML files in .beads/formulas/ that define workflow structure\n- **Cook**: Transform formula to proto beads (with [template] label)\n- **Proto**: Template beads with child beads for each step\n- **Pour**: Proto to Mol (persistent liquid)\n- **Wisp**: Proto to Wisp (ephemeral vapor)\n\n## What's Wrong\n\nWe have legacy code and docs that use the OLD model where molecules are defined\nin Go code as structs with embedded markdown, instead of as formula YAML cooked into proto beads.\n\n---\n\n## MAJOR ISSUES\n\n### 1. Go Code: molecules_*.go (DELETE OR REWRITE)\n\n**Files:**\n- internal/beads/builtin_molecules.go\n- internal/beads/molecules_patrol.go (19KB!)\n- internal/beads/molecules_session.go (13KB)\n- internal/beads/molecules_work.go (13KB)\n\n**Problem:** Defines molecules as Go structs with embedded markdown descriptions.\nThis is completely wrong. Molecules should come from:\n1. Formula YAML files cooked into proto beads\n2. Proto beads with child beads for each step\n\n**Used by:**\n- install.go:seedBuiltinMolecules() - seeds during install\n- catalog.go - includes in catalog\n- molecule_list.go:ExportBuiltinMolecules()\n\n**Fix:** Delete these files. Create formula YAML files instead. Update seeding\nto cook formulas into protos.\n\n### 2. Role Templates: Steps Listed in Markdown (REWRITE)\n\n**Files:**\n- prompts/roles/deacon.md - Lists 7 patrol steps\n- prompts/roles/refinery.md - Lists 10 patrol steps\n- prompts/roles/witness.md - Procedural \"Heartbeat Protocol\" (not molecule-based!)\n- prompts/roles/polecat.md - References molecule steps\n\n**Problem:** The steps are listed in the markdown template, but they should be\ndiscovered from the proto beads via bd mol current. Templates should say\n\"check your hook, run your patrol\" without duplicating step definitions.\n\n**Fix:** Templates should describe HOW to run a patrol (propulsion principle,\nbd mol current, bd close --continue), not WHAT the steps are.\n\n### 3. Protos are Empty/Missing (CREATE)\n\n**Current state:**\n- gt-iep9 (mol-deacon-patrol) - Only 2 child steps\n- gt-qflq (mol-witness-patrol) - EMPTY (0 children)\n- mol-refinery-patrol - DOESN'T EXIST\n\n**Fix:** Create formula YAML files for each patrol, cook them into proper protos\nwith child beads for each step.\n\n---\n\n## MEDIUM ISSUES\n\n### 4. Command Confusion: spawn vs pour/wisp\n\n**Files:**\n- prompts/roles/deacon.md - Uses bd mol spawn ... --assignee=deacon\n- prompts/roles/refinery.md - Uses bd mol spawn ... --wisp\n- Various docs\n\n**Problem:** The correct commands per molecular-chemistry.md:\n- bd pour proto - Create persistent mol (liquid)\n- bd wisp proto - Create ephemeral wisp (vapor)\n- bd mol spawn - Old/deprecated\n\n**Fix:** Update all references to use bd wisp for patrols, bd pour for\npersistent work.\n\n### 5. Command Confusion: gt mol vs bd mol\n\n**Files:** Various docs and templates\n\n**Problem:** Some use gt mol status, others bd mol status. Need to clarify:\n- gt mol = Gas Town wrapper (if it exists, what does it add?)\n- bd mol = Beads molecule commands (authoritative)\n\n**Fix:** Audit and standardize. If gt mol is a thin wrapper, remove it.\n\n### 6. polecat-wisp-architecture.md (UPDATE OR DELETE)\n\n**File:** docs/polecat-wisp-architecture.md\n\n**Problem:** References adding molecules to builtin_molecules.go - old model.\n\n### 7. manager.go (UPDATE)\n\n**File:** internal/rig/manager.go\n\n**Problem:** Comment references \"subset of builtin_molecules.go for seeding\"\n\n---\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION ORDER\n\n1. **Create formula YAML files** for the 3 patrol molecules:\n   - mol-deacon-patrol.formula.yaml\n   - mol-witness-patrol.formula.yaml\n   - mol-refinery-patrol.formula.yaml\n\n2. **Implement bd cook** if not already working to create protos from formulas\n\n3. **Cook the formulas** into proto beads with proper child beads\n\n4. **Update role templates** to use propulsion principle without step lists\n\n5. **Delete molecules_*.go** once formulas are working\n\n6. **Update install.go** to cook formulas instead of seeding Go structs\n\n7. **Audit gt mol vs bd mol** and standardize","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-24T12:37:49.601971-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.713364-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-ingm","depends_on_id":"gt-6y8u","type":"relates-to","created_at":"2025-12-24T13:25:18.856554-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.713364-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

We want an alternative: sling mol-ready-work at them and they crank through backlogs until:\n- The overseer interrupts with new instructions\n- Context fills up (request handoff)\n- Backlogs are empty\n\n## Backlogs (Priority Order)\n\n1. **Open PRs** - Review/merge pending pull requests\n2. **Untriaged GH issues** - New issues needing triage\n3. **Open beads work** - bd ready items (unblocked issues)\n4. **Triaged GH issues** - Bugs/features to implement\n\n## Key Features\n\n### ROI-Based Selection\nInstead of strict priority, agent applies ROI heuristic:\n- Size estimate (fits in remaining context?)\n- Achievability (has all needed info?)\n- Impact (priority + type weight)\n- Pick highest-value achievable item\n\n### Context Management\n- Check token usage after each work item\n- Request handoff before running out\n- Leave clear handoff notes (mail to self)\n- Next session picks up the patrol\n\n### Patrol Loop Structure\n```\norient → scan-backlogs → select-work → execute-work → check-context → (loop or handoff)\n```\n\n## Design Questions\n\n1. How does gt sling work? Does it exist?\n2. How does this interact with the normal crew patrol?\n3. Should the molecule go in Gas Town catalog or per-rig?\n4. How does bonding work for discovered work during execution?\n5. Should this be a wisp (ephemeral) or mol (persistent)?\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] mol-ready-work protomolecule defined in catalog\n- [ ] gt sling command implemented (or existing mechanism documented)\n- [ ] Context-checking step works with agent token awareness\n- [ ] Handoff mechanism integrates with gt mail\n- [ ] Documentation for crew workers on using the patrol","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-22T23:45:40.63509-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:56.309081-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:56.309081-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

{"id":"gt-sult","title":"gt spawn beads sync warning is misleading for redirect-based polecats","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen spawning a polecat, gt spawn shows a warning:\n```\nWarning: beads sync: exit status 1\n```\n\nThis is misleading because polecats using the redirect architecture (`.beads/redirect`) share the canonical database at `mayor/rig/.beads/beads.db`. The 'stale beads' indicated by the warning is just git branch divergence (main vs beads-sync), not actual data staleness.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\ngt spawn should either:\n1. Skip the beads sync check for polecats using redirects (they share the canonical DB)\n2. Or provide a clearer message like 'beads redirect active, using shared database'\n\n## Reproduction\n\n```bash\ngt spawn --issue gt-xxx --rig gastown --create\n# Shows 'Warning: beads sync: exit status 1' even though beads are current\n```\n\n## Root Cause\n\nspawn.go calls beads sync and treats any non-zero exit as a warning. But with redirects, the polecat doesn't need its own beads - it uses the canonical source via the redirect chain:\n```\npolecat/.beads/redirect -\u003e ../../.beads -\u003e gastown/.beads/redirect -\u003e mayor/rig/.beads\n```\n\n## Fix Options\n\n1. Check for .beads/redirect before calling sync\n2. Have bd sync return 0 when redirect is present\n3.

This happens even with `--no-auto-import` and `--sandbox` flags\n\n### Evidence:\n```bash\n$ bd --no-daemon pin gt-k08o --for=max\n📌 Pinned gt-k08o to max's hook\n\n$ sqlite3 beads.db 'SELECT id, pinned FROM issues WHERE id=\"gt-k08o\"'\ngt-k08o|1   # ← Correct immediately after pin\n\n$ bd --no-daemon --no-auto-import show gt-k08o\n[shows issue without pinned field]\n\n$ sqlite3 beads.db 'SELECT id, pinned FROM issues WHERE id=\"gt-k08o\"'  \ngt-k08o|0   # ← WRONG\\! bd show overwrote it\n```\n\n### Where to look:\nThe bug is likely in one of these beads code paths:\n- Some import/hydration running despite --no-auto-import\n- WAL mode not flushing before subsequent reads\n- Multi-repo or redirect handling corrupting pinned field\n\n### Workaround:\nThe handoff bead attachment mechanism (AttachMolecule) works correctly.\nThe pinned field is cosmetic for `bd hook` visibility only.\ngt sling correctly uses AttachMolecule for work assignment.\n\n### Next steps:\nCreate a beads issue to fix this properly in the bd codebase.\nThis is not a gt issue.","notes":"Created beads bug: bd-phtv in ~/gt/beads","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-23T04:41:12.668958-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.040476-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.040476-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"bug"}

Beads Sync Conflict\n\n**Scenario**: Two polecats modify same issue\n\n**Detection**:\n- bd sync fails with conflict\n- Beads tombstone mechanism handles most cases\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Beads has last-write-wins semantics\n- bd sync --force in extreme cases\n- Issues may need manual dedup\n\n### 4. Tmux Failure\n\n**Scenario**: Tmux server crashes, socket issues\n\n**Detection**:\n- All sessions inaccessible\n- \"no server running\" errors\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Kill any orphan processes\n- tmux kill-server \u0026\u0026 tmux start-server\n- All agent states reset to idle\n- Re-spawn active work\n\n### 5.

It likely:\n1. Doesn't recognize the `gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e` session pattern for crew\n2. Or misidentifies the Claude process as orphaned when it has a valid tmux parent\n\n## Workaround\n\nThe patrol formula was updated to instruct deacon not to run `--fix` if orphan-processes reports any PIDs. But this workaround failed - the deacon still killed crew.\n\n## Fix Required\n\n1. Update `internal/doctor/identity_check.go` or `branch_check.go` to properly detect crew sessions\n2.

This wastes resources and creates\nunnecessary log noise.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. **Gradual slowdown**: Deacon patrol frequency should exponentially back off\n   when there's no activity in the town.\n\n2. **Wake on activity**: Any gt or bd command (human or agent) should reset\n   the backoff immediately.\n\n3. **Daemon coordination**: Deacon needs to \"program\" the daemon for next\n   heartbeat duration.\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n### Option A: Daemon tracks last-activity timestamp\n- Daemon mechanically slows heartbeat based on time since last activity\n- Activity signal comes from gt/bd command hooks\n- Simple, no Deacon state needed\n- But: Daemon is \"dumb\" by design - adding intelligence here feels wrong\n\n### Option B: Deacon tracks patrol-count-since-activity\n- Deacon maintains counter (via label on patrol molecule or state.json)\n- Each idle patrol increments counter, calculates next sleep\n- Deacon tells daemon \"wake me in X minutes\"\n- More complex but keeps intelligence in AI agent\n\n### Option C: Discovery-based (preferred if feasible)\n- Can we detect \"no activity\" without explicit counters?\n- Ideas:\n  - Compare current time to last git commit across all clones?\n  - Check tmux activity timestamps?\n  - Look at beads modification times?\n- Pros: No state to manage\n- Cons: May be expensive to compute, could miss activity\n\n### Wake mechanism\n- Hook on gt commands (gt.hooks.pre-command or similar)\n- Hook on bd commands (bd.hooks.pre-command)\n- Both should signal daemon (SIGUSR2?) or write to activity file\n- Daemon reads activity file on each heartbeat, resets backoff if fresh\n\n### Backoff schedule (strawman)\n| Idle patrols | Next heartbeat |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| 0-5          | 5 min (default) |\n| 6-10         | 10 min |\n| 11-20        | 30 min |\n| 21+          | 60 min (max) |\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Should tmux activity count as \"activity\"? (cursor movement, typing)\n2. How does Deacon communicate next-heartbeat to daemon?\n3. Where to store backoff state?

This can INTERRUPT the Deacon mid-work, especially during long\nplugin execution or health remediation.\n\n## Solution\n\nDeacon writes a keepalive file at start of rounds:\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-12-20T15:30:00Z\",\n  \"expected_duration_minutes\": 10,\n  \"action\": \"executing mol-deacon-rounds\"\n}\n```\n\nDaemon reads this and backs off:\n- If keepalive is fresh AND within expected_duration: skip poke\n- If keepalive is stale OR past expected_duration: poke (fallback)\n\n## Files\n\n- `{townRoot}/deacon/keepalive.json` - Written by Deacon\n- Daemon already reads `{townRoot}/deacon/heartbeat.json` - similar pattern\n\n## Deacon Behavior\n\n1. Start of rounds: write keepalive with expected duration\n2. End of rounds: write heartbeat (existing), clear/update keepalive\n3. If rounds take longer than expected: Deacon gets one poke, squelches it\n\n## Daemon Changes\n\nModify `pokeDeacon()` in daemon.go:\n1. Check keepalive.json freshness and expected_duration\n2. If within bounds: skip poke, log \"Deacon active\"\n3. If past bounds: poke as fallback\n\n## Worst Case\n\nDeacon crashes mid-rounds without clearing keepalive:\n- Daemon waits until expected_duration expires\n- Then pokes, triggering respawn loop\n- Max delay: expected_duration (configurable, default 10-15 min)\n\n## Configuration\n\nIn pinned kernel bead:\n```yaml\nconfig:\n  rounds_expected_duration_minutes: 10\n```\n","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:46:47.212234-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:56.70315-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-id36.3","depends_on_id":"gt-id36","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:46:47.213911-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:56.70315-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}

Poke Mayor\n2. For each rig: Poke Witness\n3. Process lifecycle requests from daemon/ inbox\n4. Check for dead sessions, restart if cycle requested\n\n## Lifecycle Request Handling\n\nDaemon checks its inbox (daemon/) for lifecycle requests:\n- From Mayor: cycle/restart Mayor session\n- From Witnesses: cycle/restart Witness session\n\nOn request:\n1. Verify agent state shows requesting_cycle\n2. Kill session\n3. Start new session\n4. Clear requesting_cycle flag\n\n## Poke Protocol\n\nPoke = tmux inject \"HEARTBEAT: do your job\"\n- Agent ignores if already working\n- Agent wakes up if idle\n- Idempotent - multiple pokes are fine\n\n## Lifecycle Hierarchy\n\n- Daemon manages: Mayor, all Witnesses\n- Witness manages: Polecats, Refinery (per rig)\n- Crew: self-managed (human workspace)\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- gt-kmn.11: Daemon heartbeat details\n- gt-gby: gt handoff command (unified lifecycle)\n- gt-u1j.9: Fold witness daemon into this","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-17T21:50:09.763719-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:54.228427-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-99m","depends_on_id":"gt-hw6","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-17T22:23:43.253877-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:54.228427-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"gt-5gq8r","title":"gt mol step done: Auto-continue molecule on step completion","description":"## Summary\n\nImplement `gt mol step done \u003cstep-id\u003e` command that enables polecats to close a molecule step and automatically continue to the next step without waiting for witness orchestration.\n\n## Problem\n\nCurrently, when a polecat completes a molecule step:\n1. Polecat sends POLECAT_DONE to witness\n2. Witness (in patrol cycle) eventually reads mail\n3. Witness spawns next step\n4. **Minutes of latency possible**\n\nPolecats also forget to close beads steps (using internal TodoWrite instead), breaking the activity feed.\n\n## Solution\n\n`gt mol step done \u003cstep-id\u003e` handles everything:\n\n1. Close the beads step (`bd close \u003cstep-id\u003e`)\n2. Extract molecule ID from step (bd-mol-xga.1 → bd-mol-xga)\n3. Find next ready step (dependency-aware)\n4. If next step exists:\n   - Update hook file to point to next step\n   - Write handoff context\n   - tmux respawn-pane (fresh claude session)\n5. If molecule complete:\n   - Clear hook\n   - Send POLECAT_DONE to witness\n   - Exit session\n\n## Key Insight\n\nStep-to-step transitions are **mechanical**, not **cognitive**. No AI needed in the critical path. Pure Go automation.\n\n## Related Commands\n\n- `gt mol next \u003cmol-id\u003e` - Show next ready step(s)\n- `gt mol progress \u003cmol-id\u003e` - Already exists\n\n## Polecat Protocol Update\n\n```markdown\nWhen your hook contains a molecule step:\n1. Read the step: `bd show \u003cstep-id\u003e`\n2. Execute the work described\n3. When complete: `gt mol step done \u003cstep-id\u003e`\n\nThat is it. Do NOT manually close steps. Do NOT work multiple steps.\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Instant step transitions** (~5-10s vs minutes)\n- **Activity feed works** (steps closed as completed)\n- **Witness freed up** (safety net only, not critical path)\n- **Fresh context per step** (better attention, no accumulated confusion)\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-26T12:45:11.903532-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.908918-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.908918-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"feature"}

The first .beads found is the one to use, and parent directories are out of scope.\n\n## Note\n\nThis is a beads issue, filed here for tracking.

This will pollute the permanent database with ephemeral patrol cycles.\n\n**Root cause:**\nspawnMoleculeFromProto() with IsWisp=true uses `--db .beads-wisp/beads.db`, but the patrol TEMPLATE (e.g., gt-qp2w for mol-witness-patrol) only exists in the main database. So bd mol run fails with 'no issue found'.\n\n**The fix:**\nbd mol run needs to support reading the template from the main DB while writing the spawned instance to wisp storage. This is a cross-database spawn operation.\n\nOptions:\n1. Add `--template-db` flag to bd mol run (read template from here, write instance to --db)\n2. Copy template to wisp DB before spawning\n3. Make bd mol run automatically check main DB for templates when using wisp storage\n\n**Workaround applied (MUST REVERT):**\nSet IsWisp=false in slingToWitness/slingToRefinery/slingToDeacon patrol spawning.\n\n**Files:**\n- internal/cmd/sling.go: lines 680, 883, 1050 (IsWisp: false)\n- Needs fix in bd mol run (beads repo)","status":"tombstone","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-23T16:30:56.128658-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.469219-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.469219-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"bug"}

The mol gives it the verification step.\n\n## Why Not Code Guardrails\n\nPolecats have legitimate reasons to close issues without commits:\n- Already done (someone else fixed it)\n- Deferred (out of scope)\n- Escalated (needs human decision)\n- Duplicate (merged with another issue)\n\nA code guardrail would block all these.
