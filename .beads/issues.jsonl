Starts tmux session with Claude Code\n2. Waits 3 seconds (hardcoded)\n3. Sends nudge via NudgeSession\n\nBut Claude Code takes 10-20+ seconds to be ready. The message arrives before\nthe prompt is ready, so it appears as part of the prompt string instead of\nbeing executed.\n\n## Solution\n\nMove priming responsibility to the Deacon patrol cycle:\n\n1. gt spawn: Mark polecat as pending_prime=true in state, return immediately\n2. Deacon patrol: New step prime-pending-workers that:\n   - Scans all rigs for workers with pending_prime=true\n   - Uses WaitForClaudeReady() to poll for \"\u003e \" prompt (already exists in tmux.go)\n   - Once ready, sends gt prime + assignment nudge\n   - Clears pending_prime flag\n\n## Implementation\n\n### spawn.go changes\n- Remove the 3-second sleep (line 368)\n- Remove the NudgeSession call (lines 375-383)\n- Instead: Update polecat state with pending_prime=true\n\n### Polecat state addition\nstatus: assigned, pending_prime: true, issue: gt-xxx\n\n### Deacon patrol addition\nAdd step between inbox-check and plugin-run:\nprime-pending-workers: Check all rigs for workers marked pending_prime.\nFor each pending worker: WaitForClaudeReady(60s), then gt prime + nudge\n\n### Benefits\n- No race condition - we poll until actually ready\n- Deacon already does health checks - priming is natural fit\n- Works for polecats, witnesses, refineries, crew (unified approach)\n- Timeout handling built in\n\n## Depends on\n- Existing WaitForClaudeReady() in tmux.go (lines 384-403)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-22T17:19:33.589909-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-22T17:31:27.458838-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-22T17:31:27.458838-08:00"}

{"id":"gt-7918","title":"Patrols: Cyclic molecules for autonomous maintenance","description":"## Vision\n\nPatrols are **cyclic molecules** - workflow loops that give Gas Town its autonomous nervous system. While regular molecules are DAGs that terminate, patrols loop forever, performing maintenance tasks at varying cadences.\n\nThis is the \"steam engine\" of Gas Town: converting episodic Claude sessions into continuous autonomous operation.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### 1. Cyclic Molecules\n\nRegular molecule:     A -\u003e B -\u003e C -\u003e done\nPatrol molecule:      A -\u003e B -\u003e C --+\n                      ^             |\n                      +-------------+\n\nPatrols have a loop_to field specifying where to restart.\n\n### 2. Cooldown-Aware Steps (Atoms)\n\nSteps encode their own cadence. When patrol reaches a step:\n1. Check: now - last_run \u003e cooldown?\n2. If yes: execute, update last_run\n3. If no: skip (immediately close)\n\nThe patrol runner is simple - steps self-skip. Complexity distributed into atoms.\n\n### 3. The Beacon\n\nThe heartbeat that fires patrol triggers:\n- Internal ticker in Deacon (goroutine)\n- Or external cron firing gt deacon tick\n- Or mail-based triggers\n\nWithout beacon, nothing proactive happens.\n\n### 4. Session Reset as Patrol Step\n\nConnects to auto-handoff (gt-bcwn). Session reset is a patrol step, not a separate mechanism.\n\n### 5. Multi-Role Patrols\n\nEach supervisor has its own patrol:\n\n**Deacon patrol:** health-check (30s), session-gc (5m), beacon-tick (10s)\n**Witness patrol:** orphan-scan (10m), stuck-check (2m), molecule-progress (1m)\n**Refinery patrol:** queue-check (30s), pr-status (1m), merge-ready (30s)\n\n### 6. Cadence Tiers\n\n- Critical (10-30s): Health checks\n- Active (1-5m): Progress, nudges\n- Maintenance (10-30m): Orphans, GC\n- Periodic (1h+): Reports\n\n### 7. Best-Effort Scheduling\n\nNot real-time - more like cron. No hard deadlines. Catch-up, dont pile-up.\nPriority preemption (mail interrupts patrol). Graceful degradation under load.\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. State persistence: Beads (self-describing) or file (faster)?\n2. Interruption: How does urgent mail preempt patrol?\n3. Error recovery: Backoff? Escalate? Circuit breaker?\n4. Coordination: Can patrols send mail to trigger other patrols?\n\n## Related\n\n- gt-bcwn: Auto-handoff (session reset is a patrol step)\n- Molecule system (patrols extend molecules with loops)\n- Deacon lifecycle management\n\n## Metaphor\n\nClaude was fire. Claude Code was steam. Gas Town is the steam engine. Beads is the train tracks.\n\nThe steam engine converts episodic combustion into continuous rotary motion.\nGas Town converts episodic Claude sessions into continuous autonomous work.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-21T12:18:22.99128-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T12:18:22.99128-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-7918","depends_on_id":"gt-bcwn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-21T12:18:30.86651-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Add RefineryPatrolMolecule() to builtin_molecules.go\n- Copy pattern from DeaconPatrolMolecule\n- Include all steps with proper `Needs:` dependencies\n- Emphasize handle-failures gate in description\n\n### 2. Update Refinery CLAUDE.md\nAdd sections:\n- **The Engineer Mindset** (identity/philosophy)\n- **The Scotty Test** (Would Scotty walk past this?)\n- **Patrol Molecule** reference (mol-refinery-patrol)\n- **Test Failure Protocol** (explicit decision tree)\n\n### 3. Create prompts/roles/refinery.md\n- Follow pattern of deacon.md\n- Include patrol execution loop diagram\n- Reference the molecule\n\n### 4.

Use that directory (closest ancestor wins)\n2. **Stop searching upward** - do not look for parent .beads directories\n3. **No warning** about multiple databases\n\n## Current Behavior\n\nbd searches all the way up to root, finds all .beads directories, and warns about \"multiple databases\" even though they are separate, intentional instances.\n\n## Fix\n\nIn the database discovery code, stop the upward search as soon as a .beads directory is found. The first .beads found is the one to use, and parent directories are out of scope.\n\n## Note\n\nThis is a beads issue, filed here for tracking.

Cleaner escalation: Mayor only hears about problems\n\n## What Witness Handles\n\n- Verifying worker git state before kill\n- Nudging workers to fix dirty state\n- Killing worker sessions\n- Updating worker state (sleep/wake)\n- Logging verification results\n\n## What Mayor Handles\n\n- Receiving swarm complete notifications\n- Deciding whether to start new swarms\n- Handling escalations (stuck workers after 3 retries)\n- Cross-rig coordination\n\n## Escalation Path\n\nWorker stuck -\u003e Witness nudges (up to 3x) -\u003e Witness escalates to Mayor -\u003e Mayor decides: force kill, reassign, or human\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\nDO NOT: Mayor asks Witness if worker X is clean\nDO: Witness reports swarm complete, all workers verified\n\nDO NOT: Mayor kills worker sessions directly\nDO: Mayor tells Witness to abort swarm, Witness handles cleanup\n\nDO NOT: Workers report done to Mayor\nDO: Workers report to Witness, Witness aggregates and reports up","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-15T19:48:56.678724-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T20:48:12.068964-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-gl2","depends_on_id":"gt-82y","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-15T19:49:05.929877-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

This epic makes it PROACTIVE with a structured molecule:\n\n```\nDeacon Wake\n├── Step 0: Session Check (should I cycle myself?)\n├── Step 1: Health Scan (Mayor, Witnesses, Crew, Refineries)\n├── Step 2: Lifecycle Processing (cycle/restart/shutdown requests)\n├── Step 3: Plugin Execution (scheduled, event-triggered, human-requested)\n├── Step 4: Event Callbacks (timers, subscriptions)\n└── Step 5: Heartbeat + Wait\n```\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\n1. **Session cycling first** - Token costs are quadratic with session length.\n   Deacon should aggressively cycle to fresh sessions. First step of every\n   wake is \"do I need a new session?\" based on context budget.\n\n2. **Pinned bead with marching orders** - A pinned bead (like gt prime for\n   agents) defines the Deacon's rounds molecule. This is the Deacon's\n   \"kernel\" - its operating loop.\n\n3. **Keepalive file for daemon quieting** - Instead of daemon tmux-poking\n   the Deacon (which interrupts work), Deacon writes a keepalive file.\n   Daemon reads it and backs off. Worst case: Deacon forgets, gets one\n   extra heartbeat it squelches.\n\n4. **Molecule-based rounds** - The wake cycle becomes a molecule with steps.\n   Each step can have plugins (inline attention). Steps can be added/modified\n   by updating the pinned bead.\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\nGo Daemon (minimal, dumb)\n├── Reads {townRoot}/deacon/keepalive.json\n├── If fresh: do nothing\n├── If stale: poke Deacon (fallback)\n└── Process lifecycle requests (still daemon's job)\n\nDeacon (Claude agent, smart)\n├── Wakes: poke, timer, mail event\n├── Writes keepalive (quiets daemon for duration of rounds)\n├── Runs rounds molecule:\n│   ├── session-check: cycle if context budget low\n│   ├── health-scan: check agents, remediate\n│   ├── lifecycle: process requests\n│   ├── plugins: run scheduled/triggered plugins\n│   ├── events: process timer/event callbacks\n│   └── complete: update heartbeat, wait\n└── Reads marching orders from pinned bead\n```\n\n## Relation to Existing Work\n\n- Extends gt-5af (Deacon infrastructure) - CLOSED\n- Relates to gt-axz (Plugin architecture) - P3\n- Fits into phase3-deacon of gt-ngpz (Christmas Plan)\n- Enables gt-976 (Crew lifecycle) as part of health-scan step\n","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:46:08.076178-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-20T21:46:08.076178-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-id36","depends_on_id":"gt-976","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:48:05.215593-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

The 'stale beads' indicated by the warning is just git branch divergence (main vs beads-sync), not actual data staleness.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\ngt spawn should either:\n1. Skip the beads sync check for polecats using redirects (they share the canonical DB)\n2. Or provide a clearer message like 'beads redirect active, using shared database'\n\n## Reproduction\n\n```bash\ngt spawn --issue gt-xxx --rig gastown --create\n# Shows 'Warning: beads sync: exit status 1' even though beads are current\n```\n\n## Root Cause\n\nspawn.go calls beads sync and treats any non-zero exit as a warning. But with redirects, the polecat doesn't need its own beads - it uses the canonical source via the redirect chain:\n```\npolecat/.beads/redirect -\u003e ../../.beads -\u003e gastown/.beads/redirect -\u003e mayor/rig/.beads\n```\n\n## Fix Options\n\n1.

This replaces the normal \"await instructions\" patrol step with productive backlog processing.\n\n## Context\n\nCrew workers like dave/joe are persistent, user-managed agents. Currently their patrol loop has an \"await instructions\" step that idles. We want an alternative: sling mol-ready-work at them and they crank through backlogs until:\n- The overseer interrupts with new instructions\n- Context fills up (request handoff)\n- Backlogs are empty\n\n## Backlogs (Priority Order)\n\n1. **Open PRs** - Review/merge pending pull requests\n2. **Untriaged GH issues** - New issues needing triage\n3. **Open beads work** - bd ready items (unblocked issues)\n4. **Triaged GH issues** - Bugs/features to implement\n\n## Key Features\n\n### ROI-Based Selection\nInstead of strict priority, agent applies ROI heuristic:\n- Size estimate (fits in remaining context?)\n- Achievability (has all needed info?)\n- Impact (priority + type weight)\n- Pick highest-value achievable item\n\n### Context Management\n- Check token usage after each work item\n- Request handoff before running out\n- Leave clear handoff notes (mail to self)\n- Next session picks up the patrol\n\n### Patrol Loop Structure\n```\norient → scan-backlogs → select-work → execute-work → check-context → (loop or handoff)\n```\n\n## Design Questions\n\n1. How does gt sling work? Does it exist?\n2. How does this interact with the normal crew patrol?\n3. Should the molecule go in Gas Town catalog or per-rig?\n4.

Agent Crash Mid-Operation\n\n**Scenario**: Polecat crashes while committing, Witness crashes while verifying\n\n**Detection**:\n- Session suddenly gone (tmux check fails)\n- State shows 'working' but no session\n- Heartbeat stops (for Witness)\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Doctor detects via ZombieSessionCheck\n- Capture any recoverable state\n- Reset agent state to 'idle'\n- For Witness: auto-restart via supervisor or manual gt witness start\n\n### 2. Git State Corruption\n\n**Scenario**: Merge conflict, failed rebase, detached HEAD\n\n**Detection**:\n- Git commands fail\n- Dirty state that won't commit\n- Branch diverged from origin\n\n**Recovery**:\n- gt doctor reports git health issues\n- Manual intervention recommended\n- Severe cases: remove clone, re-clone\n\n### 3. Beads Sync Conflict\n\n**Scenario**: Two polecats modify same issue\n\n**Detection**:\n- bd sync fails with conflict\n- Beads tombstone mechanism handles most cases\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Beads has last-write-wins semantics\n- bd sync --force in extreme cases\n- Issues may need manual dedup\n\n### 4. Tmux Failure\n\n**Scenario**: Tmux server crashes, socket issues\n\n**Detection**:\n- All sessions inaccessible\n- \"no server running\" errors\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Kill any orphan processes\n- tmux kill-server \u0026\u0026 tmux start-server\n- All agent states reset to idle\n- Re-spawn active work\n\n### 5. Claude API Issues\n\n**Scenario**: Rate limits, outages, context limits\n\n**Detection**:\n- Sessions hang or produce errors\n- Repeated failure patterns\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Exponential backoff (handled by Claude Code)\n- For context limits: session cycling (mail-to-self)\n- For outages: wait and retry\n\n### 6. Disk Full\n\n**Scenario**: Clones, logs, or beads fill disk\n\n**Detection**:\n- Write operations fail\n- git/bd commands error\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Clean up logs: rm ~/.gastown/logs/*\n- Remove old polecat clones\n- gt doctor --fix can clean some cruft\n\n### 7. Network Failure\n\n**Scenario**: Can't reach GitHub, API servers\n\n**Detection**:\n- git fetch/push fails\n- Claude sessions hang\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Work continues locally\n- Queue pushes for later\n- Sync when connectivity restored\n\n## Recovery Principles\n\n1. **Fail safe**: Prefer stopping over corrupting\n2. **State is recoverable**: Git and beads have recovery mechanisms\n3. **Doctor heals**: gt doctor --fix handles common issues\n4. **Emergency stop**: gt stop --all as last resort\n5. **Human escalation**: Some failures need Overseer intervention\n\n## Implementation\n\n- Document each failure mode in architecture.md\n- Ensure doctor checks cover detection\n- Add recovery hints to error messages\n- Log all failures for debugging","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:19:07.198289-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-15T23:19:28.171942-08:00"}

Add SIGUSR1 handler in daemon that calls ProcessLifecycleRequests()\n2. gt handoff reads daemon.pid and sends SIGUSR1 after mail send\n\n### Option B: Unix Socket\n1. Daemon listens on ~/gt/daemon/lifecycle.sock\n2. gt handoff connects and sends 'process' message\n\n### Option C: Watchfile + fsnotify\n1. gt handoff touches ~/gt/daemon/lifecycle.trigger\n2.
